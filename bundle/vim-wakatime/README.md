2. Using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):<br />
  `echo "Bundle 'wakatime/vim-wakatime'" >> ~/.vimrc && vim +BundleInstall`

  or using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):<br />
  `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone git://github.com/wakatime/vim-wakatime.git`

3. Enter your [api key](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey) from [https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey), then press `enter`.

4. Use Vim like you normally do and your time will be tracked for you automatically.
